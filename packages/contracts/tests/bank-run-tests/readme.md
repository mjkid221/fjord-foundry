This is where one should place all test cases that use the bankrun client over the standard Anchor defined provider. The `yarn test` command has been setup to copy the Anchor.toml file into the test directory to allow the BankrunProvider.

Bankrun is a Solana test suite tool like Anchor with additional utility functions to make testing easier.
